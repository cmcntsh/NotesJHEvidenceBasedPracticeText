# Notes on Johns Hopkins Evidence-Based Practice Fourth Edition

These notes come from the book *Johns Hopkins Evidence-Based Practice for Nurses and Healthcare Professionals: Model and Guidelines, Fourth Edition* (Dang et al., 2021). I focus heavily on suggested actions. (2025 update) There is a new fifth edition available. https://search-ebscohost-com.ezproxy.lib.utah.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&db=nlebk&AN=4174556&site=ehost-live&ebv=EB&ppid=pp_C1

## Part 1 EBP Background

### Ch 1 EBP: Context, Concerns, Challenges

* EBP Definition: "EBP is a problem-solving approach to clinical decision-making within a healthcare organization. EBP integrates the best available scientific evidence with the best available experiential (patient and practitioner) evidence. EBP uses a deliberate approach to consider internal and external influences on practice and to encourage critical thinking in the judicious application of such evidence to the care of individual patients, a patient population, or a system (Dang & Dearholt, 2018)." p. 5
* Nice section on history of EBP.
* Nice references section.

### Ch 2 Creating a Supportive EBP Environment

## Part 2 JH EBP Model

* Choosing a model helps ensure a consistent approach.
* Four key strategies: committed leadership, establish culture, build capacity, create sustainability.
* Leaders level of committment: "let it happen", "help it happen", "make it happen"
* Need strategic plan
* Identify and develop mentors and informal leaders
* Overcome barriers to foster EBP culture: lack of supportive leadership, lack of infrastructure, team member attitudes, lack of communication, lack of incentives
* Manage transitions: see appendix A, talk about perceived losses, tailor to local circumstances, minimize overreaction, describe goal, explain the plan, staff participation
* Build capacity: develop EBP knowledge and skills, access to information, interprofessional collaboration, sustain change, setting expectations for EBP, have change committee, have communication plan
* Communication plan: goals of communication, target audiences, available media, preferred frequency, important messages

### Ch 3 Process Overview

* Essential components: inquiry, practice, learning
* 3 phases: practice question, evidence, translation
* 20 step process
  1. Recruit interprofessional team
  2. Determine responsibility for project leadership
  3. Schedule team meetings
  4. Clarify and describe the problem
  5. Develop and refine the EBP question (PICO - Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome)
  6. Determine the need for an EBP project
  7. Identify stakeholders
  8. Search for evidence (internal and external)
  9. Appraise level and quality of pieces of evidence
  10. Summarize individual evidence
  11. Synthesize findings
  12. Develop best evidence recommendations
  13. Identify practice setting-specific recommendations
  14. Create action plan
  15. Secure support and resources to implement action plan
  16. Implement action plan
  17. Evaluate outcomes to see if improvement
  18. Report results to stakeholders
  19. Identify next steps
  20. Disseminate findings

## Part 3 Practice Question, Evidence, Translation (PET)

### Ch 4 Practice Question Phase

* Practice question phase has 7 steps (see #1-7)
* Rogers's Theory of Diffusion of Innovation: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, laggards
* Characteristics of informal leaders: part of local peer group, wide sphere of influence, trusted to judge fit between innovation and unit norms, use of innovation influences peers and alters group norms
* Qualities of productive team (Google): psychological safety, dependability, structure and clarity, meaning, impact
* Practices of good leader: stay neutral, question to get to root cause, active listening, continuously paraphrase, summarize discussions, record with accurate notes, synthesize ideas, keep on track, test assumptions, manage climate
* Define the practice problem (#4): phrase in terms of knowledge gap, state problem not symptoms, be precise, examine critically, ask clarifying questions, don't blame on wrong aspect, restate the problem differently, challenge assumptions, expand and contract the problem, assume multiple solutions
* 2 types of questions: background (broad) and foreground (narrow and specific)
* Use PICO to write an answerable question

### Ch 5 Searching for Evidence

* Primary evidence: patient contact
* Search process described here
* Several literature sources described here. Newer sources are not described. CINAHL, MEDLINE and PubMed, The Cochrane Library, JBI (Janna Briggs Institute), PsycINFO, Health and Psychosocial Instruments (HaPI), Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), Sigma repository, TRIP medical database, US Preventive Services Task Force, ClinicalTrials.gov, NIH RePORTER, Google Scholar
* Query construction techniques discussed
